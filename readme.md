OpenMarket is an open-source, decentralized marketplace, where you can sell anything in exchange for bitcoin. The network and website is hosted by any seller running software installed from this page. 

It comes with an integrated [BitcoinJ](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj)-based [Bitcoin wallet](http://tchoulihan.github.io/bitmerchant/) so you can immediately start accepting payments without having to go through an intermediary service like coinbase or bitpay;


## Features include
* A complete
* A decentrally hosted database, built atop [rqlite](https://github.com/otoolep/rqlite).
* A fully portable website and service, built with java [Spark](https://github.com/perwendel/spark).
* An offline bitcoin [wallet](http://tchoulihan.github.io/bitmerchant/) that uses [BIP70](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki).
* Refund orders at the click of a button.
