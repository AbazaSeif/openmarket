**Currently alpha testing on the bitcoin test network**

[OpenMarket](http://104.236.98.130:4568/) is an open-source, decentralized marketplace, like amazon or etsy, where you can sell anything in exchange for bitcoin. The network and website is hosted by any seller running software installed from this page, and accessible by any of the running network nodes that keep a complete copy of the database.

It comes with a local-only, integrated [BitcoinJ](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj)-based [Bitcoin wallet](http://github.com/tchoulihan/bitmerchant) so you can immediately start accepting payments without having to go through an intermediary service like coinbase or bitpay. 

To see what its all about, check out [a sample OpenMarket website](http://104.236.98.130:4568/)


## Features include
* A complete web store including product reviews, ratings, wishlists, shipping tracking urls, feedback, categories, etc.
* A decentrally hosted database, built atop [rqlite](https://github.com/otoolep/rqlite). 
* A fully portable webservice and website built with java [Spark](https://github.com/perwendel/spark). *No web server required*
* An offline bitcoin [wallet](http://github.com/tchoulihan/bitmerchant) that uses [BIP70](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki). 
* A [network page](http://104.236.98.130:4568/network) showing the connected nodes.

## Installation
### Requirements
- Java 8
- Go (version at least 1.4) 
  - [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) is the best way to install go.
- If behind a router, make sure ports 4566-4570 are correctly forwarded to your local ip address.

Download the jar, located [here]()

To help test, use this command to join an existing test node that uses the bitcoin testnet:
<pre>java -jar openmarket.jar -testnet -join 96.28.13.51:4570</pre>

General usage:
<pre>java -jar openmarket.jar [parameters]</pre>
<pre>parameters:
 -deleteDB     : Delete the sqlite DB before running.(Warning, this deletes
                 your wallet too)
 -join VAL     : Startup OpenMarket joining a master node(IE, 127.0.0.1:4001)
 -loglevel VAL : Sets the log level [INFO, DEBUG, etc.]
 -port N       : Startup your webserver on a different port(default is 4567)
 -testnet      : Run using the Bitcoin testnet3, and a test DB
 -uninstall    : Uninstall OpenMarket.(Warning, this deletes your wallet too)
